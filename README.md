## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS/SCSS
- ReactJS


### What I learned

This was a project I took on to test my knoweldge and problem solving using HTML and CSS to mimic a real-world work scenario given only visual guidelines. At first I was skeptical of my abilities when I started, but taking it one step at a time, utilizing previous projects and resources to help me find solutions really helped me succeed.

### Continued development

In the upcoming Frontend Mentor challenges, I want to explore and take on challenges that cover aspects of React (hooks, states, etc), JavaScript, and APIs.

### Useful resources

- I realize I am a visual learner. YouTube videos in conjuction with reading documentation has been critical in my success.
